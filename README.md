### Description

A collaborative project with @n1chey focused on building a fully autonomous drone system capable of detecting environmental hazards in real time.

The drone uses an onboard AI model — developed entirely by us — to analyze live camera footage and identify early signs of oil spills, smoke, or wildfires. When a threat is detected, the system automatically alerts emergency services and stores captured imagery for auditing, verification, and future model improvement.

### How to Use
1. Train the AI model using `trainthebrain.py`
2. Launch the main interface with `website.py`

All collected images will be saved and used in future model training cycles.

### Goal
To reduce environmental damage globally by providing fast detection, quicker emergency response, and long-term predictive AI trained on real-world data.
